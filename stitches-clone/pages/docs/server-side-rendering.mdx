The `createCss` factory automatically detects if you are in a browser or server environment. That means when you use this factory on the server it will **hash** the classnames (for rehydration abilities) and allow you to collect the styling to include in the responded html:

```jsx
const { result, styles } = css.getStyles(() => renderSomething());
```

Note that server produced CSS does not contain vendor prefixes, as there is no browser environment to look at. If you have a server rendered application you can either manually add the vendor prefixes you need, or you can use a [postcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss) to do the conversion:

```jsx
import postcss from 'postcss';
import autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer';

const { result, styles } = css.getStyles(() => renderSomething());

Promise.all(
  styles.map((style) =>
    postcss([autoprefixer({ browsers: ['> 1%', 'last 2 versions'] })]).process(style)
  )
).then((styles) => {
  // styles with vendor prefixes
});
```

> Note: If using React, make sure to add your styles in `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
